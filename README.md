# **Flukey Feathers Badminton Club**

Flukey Feathers is a site that is designed to help people choose Badminton as a sport to play and Flukey Feathers as the club to join no matter what their skill set is.
The site is targeted towards potential or current badminton players based in or around the Bournemouth area who are looking for somewhere to play that is both friendly and social.

## **Planning Stage**

### **Target Audience**
* Users who are looking to take up badminton as a sport to play
* Users who are looking to join a badminton club
* Users who are looking to switch badminton clubs

### **Site Aims**
* Educate the user on the health benefits of playing badminton
* Show the user the benefits of playing badminton with Flukey Feathers
* Provide the user with information that tells them when and where Flukey Feathers plays
* Give the user an opportunity to contact the club to join them

### **Wireframes**
To help organise how I was going to approach building the site I first got my initial ideas down onto some wireframe to help guide me through the basic layout of the site as I implemented various features. 
Links to the different pages:
* [Homepage (About)](docs/wireframes/home-about.png)
* [Club Sessions page](docs/wireframes/club-sessions.png)
* [Join Us page](docs/wireframes/join-us.png)

There was some deviation from the initial design as I implemented each page to improve the user experience but in general I stayed true to the initial design.

### **Color Scheme**
I chose a color scheme that was in keeping with the Flukey Feathers color scheme (red) whilst also being  easy to read for the user, through the use of back ground images and the navigation / footer color schemes, opting for a smokey white background and dark grey text in areas where these weren't used.
