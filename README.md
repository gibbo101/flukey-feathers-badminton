# **Flukey Feathers Badminton Club**

Flukey Feathers is a site that is designed to help people choose Badminton as a sport to play and Flukey Feathers as the club to join no matter what their skill set is.
The site is targeted towards potential or current badminton players based in or around the Bournemouth area who are looking for somewhere to play that is both friendly and social.

## **Planning Stage**

### **Target Audience**
* Users who are looking to take up badminton as a sport to play
* Users who are looking to join a badminton club
* Users who are looking to switch badminton clubs

### **Site Aims**
* Educate the user on the health benefits of playing badminton
* Show the user the benefits of playing badminton with Flukey Feathers
* Provide the user with information that tells them when and where Flukey Feathers plays
* Give the user an opportunity to contact the club to join them

### **Wireframes**
To help organise how I was going to approach building the site I first got my initial ideas down onto some wireframe to help guide me through the basic layout of the site as I implemented various features. 
Links to the different pages:
* [Homepage (About)](docs/wireframes/home-about.png)
* [Club Sessions page](docs/wireframes/club-sessions.png)
* [Join Us page](docs/wireframes/join-us.png)

There was some deviation from the initial design as I implemented each page to improve the user experience but in general I stayed true to the initial design.

### **Color Scheme**
I chose a color scheme that was in keeping with the Flukey Feathers color scheme (red) whilst also being  easy to read for the user, through the use of back ground images and the navigation / footer color schemes, opting for a smokey white background and dark grey text in areas where these weren't used. 

## **Features common to all Pages**
### **Hero Image**

![Hero Image](assets/images/hero-image.webp)
* Designed to catch the eye when loading the page
* In theme with the FLukey Feathers club it features a shuttle cock on a badminton court
* A smaller version of the hero image is used for mobile layouts so it take up less screen real estate and doesn't dominate the page

### **Club Logo**

![Club Logo](assets/images/flukey-feathers-logo.webp)
* Located within the hero image the logo so the user knows the site is about Flukey Feathers
* It also serves as a link back to the home page
* The logo scales on mobile screens as the screen size gets smaller so it doesn't dominate the hero image

### **Navigation Bar**

![Nav Bar](docs/read-me/nav-bar.png)
 * Located directly below the hero image
 * Its red background is designed to be eye catching and in line with Flukey Feathers' club color scheme
 * For ease of navigation as the mouse is hovered over a link, the background turns black so the user can see what they are selecting
 * The current page a user is on as a link that is underlined
 * As the page size decreases the nav bar is fully responsive and at the mobile level displays as a block vertically rather than horizontally

 ### **Footer**

![Footer](docs/read-me/footer.png)
 * Located at the bottom of the page
 * Its red background is designed to be eye catching and in line with Flukey Feathers' club color scheme
 * The footer has links to FLukey Feathers facebook page
 * There are also links to the Badminton England site and game rules site for users to explore their interest further
 * As the page size decreases the Badminton England and game rules links center on the page so they fit better in a tall narrow layout
 * Links to Badminton England and game rules are underlined to show they are 2 seperate links as they looked like 4 links (1 per word) before this was applied
 * The facebook link had its underlining removed as it was obvious this was a link
